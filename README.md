# Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-III-Review

### Summary
Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a first-person shooter that lets you experience the action that takes place on the battlefield in the distant future. It was developed by Treyarch and was released on November 6th, 2015. I focused on the Campaign mode during my playthrough. At the start there was a small character customization section, although you could only change your characters gender and face by selecting through 9 preset face options. To progress through each level, you simply have to get from point A to point B while shooting the enemies. You are equiped with a primary weapon (ex: assault rifle), a secondary weapon (ex: handgun), some offensive grenades used to kill the enemies directly, and specialty grenades used to affect the enemies without killing them directly. There is also a minor melee option given which consists of a single punch that instantly kills the enemy. After the first level of the campaign, you learn about a new movement option, wall-running.

### Final Thoughts
The first level of the campaign was boring to me, but that might have been affected by the 40 minute playtime limit I put on myself. There were no skippable cutscenes, as well as segments where I had no choice but to wait and listen to the other characters' dialogue. There were also a few occasions where I was stuck, being trapped by the ally AI that was "leading" me through the mission.

There were some fun moments in the game. The on-rails section where I took control of a turrent was fun. There was plenty of ammunition throughout the levels so I never ran out, and plenty of open space to choose how to progress. Checkpoints were not far off from each other, so you would respawn relatively close to where you had died, making it easy to get back to where you left off.

Overall, it was not a bad game, but it was not too engaging either. Fun for a short burst but that's about it.
