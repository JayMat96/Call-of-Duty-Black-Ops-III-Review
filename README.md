# Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-III-Review

### Summary
Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a first-person shooter that lets you experience the action that takes place on the battlefield in the distant future. It was developed by Treyarch and was released on November 6th, 2015. I focused on the Campaign mode during my playthrough. At the start there was a small character customization section, although you could only change your characters gender and face by selecting through 9 preset face options. To progress through each level, you simply have to get from point A to point B while shooting the enemies. You are equiped with a primary weapon (ex: assault rifle), a secondary weapon (ex: handgun), some offensive grenades used to kill the enemies directly, and specialty grenades used to affect the enemies without killing them directly. There is also a minor melee option given which consists of a single punch that instantly kills the enemy. After the first level of the campaign, you learn about a new movement option, wall-running.

### Final Thoughts
The first level of the campaign was boring to me, but that might have been affected by the 40 minute playtime limit I put on myself. There were no skippable cutscenes, as well as segments where I had no choice but to wait and listen to the other characters' dialogue.
